  <h2>Team</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>We are two students who created a robotics team in Union, Kentucky.
  We dedicate ourselves to excellence in everything that we do.
  We set ambitious goals every year to learn to build and program something new.
  Although we are not associated with any school program, we compete on the national and global level every year.
  We volunteer for many local programs to share our passion for STEM with future engineers.
  We often collaborate with our local teams to increase interest in STEM in our community.
  Every year we use our knowledge to design and build a new robot for the new VEX Robotics Compeition game.</p>

<h2 class="center">Our Story</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In 2017 the idea for Revelation Robotics was born.
        We had just finished our final year of Lego Robotics and we knew our passion for robotics needed to continue.
        By that time, we also knew that we wanted to do more than just compete and learn â€“
        we wanted to share our learnings with anyone who might benefit.
        So, we combined learning with sharing by volunteering at local robotics camps.
        Those camps gave us a great balance between learning, doing, and teaching; as we learned, we taught others.
        <br>
        <br>
        Soon we found ourselves wanting to become more competitive,
        so we started by learning how the top teams in the region achieved excellence so consistently.
        We found that process, planning, discipline, knowledge,
        and hard work were really the core key ingredients to running a winning program, so we integrated those items in ours.
        We closely studied core engineering concepts and sought mentors who could supplement our knowledge,
        and we built our own engineering process with the help of those mentors.
        We learned about Gantt charts and waterfall planning, and we began to document everything we do in our Engineering Notebook.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2019 our mentors challenged us to think, not just about what WE wanted to achieve for ourselves,
        but also what IMPACT we wanted to have on the region.
        So that year we made a choice to prioritize Community Service equally alongside our competitions.
        We spent weeks of personal time supporting the local Vex community by working at camps,
        giving personal workshops to schools and programs, and offering sessions to other programs on how to document and manage tasks,
        and how to code; we still do these things today.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is our team's fourth year competing in the VEX Robotics Competition program.
        We have seen many victories and many defeats on the playing field.
        We have seen our robots perform well and we have seen them fall apart in the heat of battle.
        While our trophies can tell the world that we are a highly competitive program, we really hope that the world can see that...
        robotics and be fun, challenging, and ultimately a great way to connect with your community.
        <br>
        <br>
        We invite you to connect with us as we continue on our journey.

            I love competiting in VEX because of there is always something new to learn.
            However, my absolute favorite part is getting to help others learn and improve."
